## About

The backend uses [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

The frontend is a [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) app that uses [`react-sweet-state`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-sweet-state) as its store and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
